            We are in another year nasad bb, a whole new year yet the same girl pa rin that i loved, love, and to love even more. sakto ba? I loved it when we crossed each other’s path. I love when we talk about ourselves, how we miss each other pag naa ta both sa layo. I love you even more as time past, as we talk to our future, and how much you made me feel I was so special to you and your life. I love you like kaayooooo juddddd. We are almost there yuki! Honestly, di nako maka wait na mag isa tag balay dooo! The moment when where close, I like it when each of us maka mention jud “Gusto ko in ani ra minti” or like “Dili na unta ta mag lagyo uii”, and I really looking forward for it jud bbi. I also want to acknowledge na even though rough sometimes ato day or like gikan ta ga lalis, we always find ourselves intact, bonded still, found solutions for every challenges, and I appreciate that so much. Kani na letter, it’s not much but I wrote it with all my heart, sorri kung encoded yuki hehe. Again, let me share myself with you, let us cross another year, full of love and excitement.  Belated Happy Birthday BBi  and Happi New Year to usssss! I love youuu kaayoooo judddd. <BR></BR>-Soli
